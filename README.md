# Boostrap Portfolio

### Description

- Goal: Use bootstrap elements with additional CSS styling
  to create a web application with three mobile responsive pages
- The pages link together for easy navigation through a tentative bio,
  portfolio, and contact pages.
- The main elements consisted of matching pre-selected images to fit
  a web broswer on several devices of varying size.

### Future Goals

- Add ALL bio information into desired areas: this is left in code comments
- Use more bootstrap elements to establish better understanding
- Commit MORE and OFTEN - I sometimes would get carried away in work and
  would later remember to commit
- Finally, spent more time researching (via google-fu) rather than attempting
  new CSS elements when code is not working properly
